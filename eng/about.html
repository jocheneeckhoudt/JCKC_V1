                    <h1>An idea becomes reality.</h1><br>
                    <h3>Like every year, I started thinking about what I was going to do to pimp my Christmas cards this year around June. 
                        Rather quickly, the idea was conceived to link the cards to a website in order to provide some more information about 
                        why the fuck I am doing what I am doing. This was a pretty big task, considering my then total lack of any HTML, CSS or 
                        Javascript skills. Despite this, I took on the challenge (with the help of chatGPT where necessary) and eventually 
                        arrived at a more or less functional website. Admittedly, it isn't really well optimized and contains quite a lot 
                        of redundant and unnecessary code, but I am still quite pleased. To put it online, the files were placed on 
                        github pages, coupled to the domainname jochenscrazykerstkaartcarrousel.be and job done. All things considered, 
                        the whole process took up a few weekends though :(.

                    <h1 align="right">Creating art or something.</h1><br>
                    <h3>Once the website was finished, I could start working on the card itself. This starts by listing up all the 
                        elements I want my card to contain this year. A part of that, I can just think up on the spot, like the neural 
                        network at the center of this years card (considering the controversy about the physics and chemistry nobel 
                        prizes this year), but for the remainder, I need to refresh my memory on what exactly set the past year apart. 
                        Once the list is complete, I choose a color pattern and situate where all the different elements need to fall. 
                        This year a QR code needed to be added as well. For this purpose, a dynamical QR code was appropriate, since 
                        it allows to make changes to the link that could still fail, even after printing. Next, all the elements are 
                        drawn out (on a computer or on paper prior to being scanned) and thrown together in GIMP (free photoshop). 
                        A nice filter on top can improve the final result and once I am pleased, the cards can be ordered online (Drukzo).

                    <h1>A difficult balance.</h1><br>
                    <h3>Once the cards have been ordered and are on their way to me, the time has come to assemble the list of recipients, 
                        starting from the excel list of past year. Because I refuse to accept that my social circle is shrinking, I add a few 
                        more people to the list to the extent that my budget allows it. The budget of this year has suffered a bit under the 
                        weight of putting a website online, but less than one might think. After doing this, I contact the people of whom 
                        I suspect that their adress isn't up to date. Once all adresses are confirmed, I have them printed on stickers together 
                        with a return adres sticker for each recipient. These stickers make the next step a lot less time consuming.

                        pressed for time. During what is a very monotonous process, all stickers are attached to the envelopes and a card is 
                        added to every one of them. I try to take my time for actually writing the personalized message and making a little 
                        drawing on the back. Finally, what remains is to glue the envelope shut and send them.
