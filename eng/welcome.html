                    <p><hr>While I have long professed that Christmas is not a holiday but a frame of mind to honor in your heart and keep it all the year, the dark and dreary days that descend upon December seem to instill this feeling in the larger population as well. It was in this fine seasoning for joy to think of those we love and amidst the peculiar confines of a little pandemic that the thought came to me to simultaneously spread comradeship and quench the boredom in my soul through the simple medium of Christmas cards. For it is through giving that we receive, postcards were swiftly drawn up and dispatched through the hills and dells of pastoral Belgium to reach many beloved friends and family. <hr>
After a successful first edition, a mere taste for the festive correspondence blossomed into a fondness and eventually, a devotion bordering on obsession. Nevertheless, a dream was born to bring the holiday spirit to every hearth beneath the heavens. For this year, however, a more humble target of one hundred addressees will suffice. <hr>
Since you are here, you may have noticed that this year a digital accompaniment has been added to the more venerable tradition of the written word. Take this as a modest supplement to the card that conveys the essence of the time, namely that I wish you a merry Christmas, a happy and blissful new year and that in spirit, I am with you always, till the end of time. <hr>
Yours sincerely,<br>
Jochen Pedro G. Eeckhoudt</p>

                        <h1>The Process</h1>
                        <p>The goal of Jochen’s Crazy Christmas Card Carousel is to bring joy to  everyone under the form of a funny little postcard. These cards are usually full of easter eggs and increase in number as the years go by. This year, almost a hundred cards are making their way to Jochen’s friends and family, and next year, probably even more. Obviously, these cards don't send themselves and a lot of work goes into getting them to their proper recipients.</p>

                        <p>This is already the fourth year of this event and hopefully not nearly the last. Here you can find the cards from 2023 and 2022. If you still have the cards of years before that, be sure to send them to me, since I can sadly no longer find them ☹.</p>

                        <p>It may not surprise some of you, but this endeavor is slowly taking up a larger and larger budget. While the financial toll is still very bearable at the moment, a future moment might come when all support is welcome in reaching the final goal: a Christmas card for everyone.</p>
